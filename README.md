Add script in Google Ads and make sure to schedule it after testing

The script will download itemID data daily (or as per scheduling) and refresh the sheet data

The 'stats' tab will do the maths, you can change your ROAS buckets in stats!L2:L8, assign custom labels to ROAS buckets in column R, check the output in column T to W

Change the custom label number in the custom_label sheet to one of the free custom labels for your merchant.

Use Merchant Center supplemental feed to import and refresh data on a daily basis

Segment campaigns based on custom labels and assign ROAS targets accordingly (high ROAS target to your underperforming products, lower ROAS target to high performers)
